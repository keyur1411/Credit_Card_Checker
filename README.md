# Credit Card Validator

A lightweight and simple **JavaScript credit card validator** that performs real-time checks as the user enters their card details.
It validates the **card number** using the Luhn algorithm, detects the **card type**, verifies the **expiry date**, and checks the **CVV** format.
The script also updates the UI instantly by showing warnings for invalid fields and displaying the correct card icon when a valid number is detected.
Easy to integrate and fully built with plain JavaScript.
